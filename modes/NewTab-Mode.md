## New Tab mode

### How to use
> Use Steward directly on the new tab

> Due to Chrome forcing the new tab cursor focus only in the address bar, in order to use Steward's features, requires the user to use a **tab** key to switch to Steward's page

### Features
> You can use all browser plugins

### Specialty
> There are wallpapers from `bing.com`, left and right below the screen, respectively, for the save and refresh buttons.
